# Machine-Learning-from-disaster-Titanic-
This project explores the Titanic disaster by analyzing passenger data to predict survival likelihood based on factors like age, gender, and socio-economic class.
We identified relevant features and understood their significance in determining survival outcomes. Through data visualization, we highlighted key patterns and the importance of different attributes.
Initially, we applied various machine learning models, but they did not perform as expected. To improve accuracy, we implemented deep learning models, 
which showed significantly better results. This analysis provides valuable insights into survival factors and demonstrates the potential of advanced predictive modelling in real-world scenarios.
